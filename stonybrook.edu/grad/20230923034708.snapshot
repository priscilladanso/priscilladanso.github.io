Her advisor, Resit Akcakaya, shared, \u201cWhat stands out most in Anna\u2019s teaching is the enthusiasm she conveys to the students about the subject matter, coupled with the high standards she expects of herself and her students. She demonstrates that one can be a \u201cfun\u201d TA while also being a tough TA with high academic standards and expectations.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brianna Gonzalez, a PhD candidate in the Integrative Neuroscience program, was back for her second time at this ceremony to be recognized for her commitment to teaching at Stony Brook.
